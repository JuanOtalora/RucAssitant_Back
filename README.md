# RUC Assitant Back
Project 2: Web development. The RUC is a tool for evaluating the performance of companies in Occupational Health and Safety controls. It is issued by the Colombian Security Council. In order for a company to acquire the RUC, it has to have an entire SSOA plan implemented and keep the use formats of these up to date. Our idea is to implement an application that facilitates the company to manage all its Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) activities. This repository contains the back of the web application.
